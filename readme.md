# 🧱 CardCorp Blog Blocks

Custom Gutenberg blocks for CardCorp and BillPro blog content. Brand-aware, minimal, and extensible.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Each block has its own build process and dependencies. You’ll need to `cd` into each block folder to run scripts.

### 2. Build or watch a block

```bash
cd did-you-know
npm run build      # For production build
npm run start      # For development (watch mode)
```

> Add more blocks using `@wordpress/create-block`, then follow the same structure.

## 📦 Create ZIP for Plugin Installation

To generate a plugin `.zip` from the root **without unnecessary files** like `node_modules`, `build/`, `.git`, etc.:

```bash
zip -r cardcorp-blog-blocks.zip . \
  -x "*node_modules*" \
  -x "*.git*" \
  -x "*build*" \
  -x "readme.md"
```

This creates a flat zip with everything needed for installation via WordPress admin.

tree -L 3 -I "node_modules"
.

## 🧩 Notes

- Blocks are brand-themed using a global class (`.brand-cardcorp`, `.brand-billpro`) applied to `<body>`.
- Styles must be defined in both `style.scss` and `editor.scss` if they should apply to frontend + editor.
- Each block is self-contained and modular.
